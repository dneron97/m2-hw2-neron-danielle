    <title>WELCOME TO MY LIFE </title> 
    <body> Hello. My name is Danielle. listed below is a collection of my hobbies, interests, and goals. </body>
    <h1> My favorite hobbies </h1>
    <h2> How I like spending time</h2>
    <p> I have a variety of hobbies and enjoy each of them for different reasons.  
        There are a few that I enjoy independently and some that I like with family and friends. Below are some of my favorites. </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Spending time outdoors (hiking, walking, riding bike, etc.) </li> 
            <li> Playing board games/completing puzzles </li>
            <li> Reading books (my favorite genre is fantasy)</li> 
            <li> Bonding with animals </li> 
         </ol>
    <p> I wanted to expand a little more on each section. I currently live in Gainesville, so I love being by nature. Two of my favorite places here are Payne's Prairie and Loblolly Woods. 
        I haven't lived in Gainesville for too long, and I think board games are a fun group activity when meeting new people. I recently tried Throw Throw Burrito.
        I just set up my Goodreads 2022 challenge and hoping to complete it. I am currently reading Where The Crawdads Sing by Dalia Owens.
        I have fun visiting with animals. I mainly spend time with dogs and cats but love seeing others! </p>
    <h1>  Interests of mine </h1>
    <p> Over the past year, I encouraged myself to engage in more interests. I am experimenting with cooking. I am creating meals through some of my staple items: rice, beans, eggs, etc. It is important to me since I want to be healthy and save money!
        I want like to visit new places. Florida has so much to offer, and I hope to explore more. I want to exercise more, so I should use my apartment's gym more.
        Some of my general interests include animals, film, and nature. </p>
    <h1> Career goals </h1>
     <h2>Where I've been and where I'm going </h2>
    <p> In college, I mostly wanted to work on films and create content. However, I participated in the Disney College Program after graduation. So, I have an interest in customer service as well. My goal is to combine these interests. I love helping others and want the content to be meaningful. 
        Disney aside, I would also be interested in helping smaller brands improve their brand awareness. 
        Another career goal is to advance in my field. I have had many supportive supervisors over the past few years, so I am interested in supervising others one day.
